# Introduction

## Introduction to Information Retrieval

In this tutorial we'll be using Python. The goals of this workshop are:

* Implement Classical and Neural IR approaches for Information Retrieval!
* Have fun!

The tutorial session is broken down into the following sections:

* Boolean Retrieval
    - Please go through the [instructions](boolean_retrieval/index.html).
* Tf-IDF Retrieval
    - Please go through the [instructions](tfidf_retriever/index.html).
* BM25  Retrieval
* BiEncoder Retrieval
    - Please go through the [instructions](neural_retriever/index.html).
